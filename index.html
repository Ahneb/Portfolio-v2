                    graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on
                    Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top
                    sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you
                    the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my
                    fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think
                    again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is
                    being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the
                    pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and
                    I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I
                    extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States
                    Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the
                    continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little
                    "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.
                    But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury
                    all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.</p>
