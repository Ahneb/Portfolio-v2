# Portfolio v2
## About
This is my second take at creating a webpage that can be used to showcase my personal works. It currently has the capability to hyperlink from the navigation section to the content sections as well as to other websites and documents. One of the key features is the websites ability to change view forms based on size of page allowing for readability on other devices.

Webpage URL: https://ahneb.github.io/Portfolio-v2/
## Features

- Hyperlink sections
- Media Query for size adjustments
- Color transitions (linear and radial fading)
## Demo

The Navigation bar can take you to the respective content areas:

The hyperlink capabilities applies to links to websites as well as shown from the github link:

The Media Queries allow for the webpage to form fit to different devices and screen sizes:

## Roadmap

- Add in hyperlink to the actual content webpages without breaking the current format of the page
    -   attempts to add ``` <a href=""></a> ``` causes ```display:flex``` and ```flex:60%``` to break
- Fix the text size issues when page is zoomed past 400%
    - also find a way to better enlarge and shrink contents on the page to make more visually appealing.
- Attach an actual Resume to webpage after fixing my Resume
- Find out how to properly inherit attributes.
    - Remove the need to call ```display:flex``` and ```flex:column/row``` every single time i make a class
- Add in hover formatting to images/ image text boxes to glow or enlarge when hovering w/ links
- Add buttons to the top of the screen.
